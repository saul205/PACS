To execute both of the environments:

	- ./env_lab6 <image_name> <number_of_execution>
	
These parameters are used to write the text file with the times and save the images.
Images are saved in a folder named: "./images/[amd/nvidia]/<image_name>/[amd/nvidia]_<image_name>_<number_of_execution>.bmp

This parameters allowed to execute multiple times to get a mean execution time while keeping the images saved separate from each other, even more important when saving every image generated to check the results.
